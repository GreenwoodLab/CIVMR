\title{SNP pre-processing.}
\usage{
SNP_reduction(snp_matrix, crit_high_cor = 0.8, maf_crit = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp_matrix:}{SNP matrix with dimension n * p.}

\item{crit_high_cor:}{criteria to choose highly correlated SNPs.}

\item{maf_crit:}{criteria to choose rare SNPs.}
}
\value{
sel_snp: the new dosage matrix of selected SNPs.

id_snp: the ids (columns) of selected SNPs in the original SNP matrix.
}
\description{
This function remove highly correlated SNPs. It also
calculate MAF for each snp and delete rare snps with low MAF (e.g. 0.01).
}
\examples{
data(simulation)
snp.rdc <- SNP_reduction(simulation$G)
}
