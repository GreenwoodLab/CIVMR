\description{
A simulated data using the same framework from simulation series I in the CIV paper.
It contains 500 subjects with one phenotype (X) of interest, one pleiotropic phenotype (Z) and
one outcome (Y) simulated for each subject. 9 SNPs were generated and they were associated with both X and Z.
The true causal effect of X on Y is 1. This data file is simulated to serve as an example
to estimate the causal effect of X on Y while accounting for
potential pleiotropic effect from Z. Users can compare the performance of different MR methods on this simulation dataset
since the true causal effect is known.
