\title{cross-validated Allele score method.}
\usage{
allele(MR.data, n_folds = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{MR.data:}{data frame containing G,X,Z,Y.}

\item{n_folds:}{the number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
weights: the weights for allele score across folds. Each row is a weight vector
corresponding to a specific fold.

allele_score: The cross-validated Allele score, which would be used as the new instruments
in MR analysis.

beta_est: the causal effect estimation of \eqn{\beta}.
}
\description{
This function implement Allele score methods with cross-validation
in the way Stephen Burgess suggested in the Allele score methods paper.
}
\examples{
data(simulation)
allele.score <- allele(simulation,n_folds=10)
}
