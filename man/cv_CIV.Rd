\title{cross-validated CIV.}
\usage{
cv_CIV(MR.data, n_folds = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{MR.data:}{a data frame containing G,X,Z,Y.}

\item{n_folds:}{number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
weights: A matrix with dimension \eqn{n_folds * p}. Each row is a CIV solution \eqn{c} from a specific fold.

civ.IV: cross-validated CIV instrument \eqn{G^{*}=Gc}.

beta_est: causal effect estimation of X on Y using CIV instrument civ.IV
}
\description{
This function produce a Constrained Instrumental Variable with cross-validation.
             Specifically, for a predefined fold the CIV is calculated using
              all samples except this fold, then the CIV solution is applied to the samples  in this fold
              to obtain corresponding CIV. In this way the correlation between samples
              are expected to be reduced.
}
\examples{
data(simulation)
cv.civ <- cv_CIV(simulation)
#strong correlation between CIV solutions from different folds.
cor(t(cv.civ$weights))
}
