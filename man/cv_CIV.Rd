\usage{
cv_CIV(temp_TSLS_data, n_folds = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{temp_TSLS_data:}{a data frame containing G,X,Z,Y.}

\item{n_folds:}{number of folds for cross-validation.}
}
\value{
civ.IV: cross-validated CIV instrument.

beta_est: causal effect estimation of X on Y using civ.IV.
}
\description{
This function generate a CIV using cross-validation.
             Specifically, for a predefined fold the CIV is calculated using
              all samples except this fold, then the CIV solution is applied to the samples in this
              fold to obtain CIV instrumentable variable. In this way the correlation between samples
              are expected to be reduced.
