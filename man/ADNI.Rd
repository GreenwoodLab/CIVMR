\usage{
data(ADNI)
}
\arguments{
\item{ADNI$Y:}{the Alzheimer's disease status. Continuous variable. The raw status is binary variable,
and we adjusted it for confounding factors such as sex, age, education ... etc.}

\item{ADNI$X:}{The phenotype of interest \eqn{A \beta} Continuous variable.}

\item{ADNI$Z:}{The potential pleiotropic phenotypes (Ptau, Ttau, Glucose levels). Continuous variables.}

\item{ADNI$G:}{genotypes. The adjusted dosage of 20 SNPs.}
}
\description{
A dataset collected from ADNI project for MR analysis in the CIV paper.
It contains 491 subjects, whose phenotypes (\eqn{A \beta}, Ptau, Ttau, Glucose levels) and
Alzheimer's status were collected. 20 SNPs associated with \eqn{A \beta} were selected and
their dosage of the 491 subjects were recorded. This data file is extracted to serve as an example
to estimate the causal effect of \eqn{A \beta} on progression of Alzheimer's disease while accounting for
potential pleiotropic effect from other phenotypes.
