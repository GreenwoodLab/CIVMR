# Synopsis

In this package we encode Constrained Instrumental Variable methods [CIV] to construct valid instrumental variables and perform adjusted causal effect estimation when pleiotropic exists, focusing particularly on the situation where pleiotropic phenotypes have been measured. We also include the codes to implement some existing methods (2SLS and Allele score methods) and their variants to account for pleiotropy. 

# Code Example
 
Two datasets are included: simulation and ADNI. A detailed walk-through are provided in the vignette to show an example of MR analysis using CIVMR.
